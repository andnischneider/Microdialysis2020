# Microdialysis2020

This repository contains analysis code for the manuscript "Reverse microdialysis of sucrose stimulates soil fungal and bacterial growth at the microscale" by Schneider et al. (2025).


This repository contains analysis scripts for both ITS and 16S sequencing data, and preprocessing code for the ITS data.

16S data was preprocessed using the [nf-core/ampliseq pipeline](https://nf-co.re/ampliseq/2.6.1/).

Preprocessed 16S and ITS data (ready to be plugged into the scripts) can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/records/15358823).
